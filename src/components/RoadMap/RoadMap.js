            It is time to disrupt the entertainment industry.
            <br /> <br /> In the past century, we have seen many different
            mediums of entertainment evolve: comic books, radio, tv, and mobile
            devices. Right now you are entering a new era - the era of the
            Metaverse. This new medium of entertainment unleashes new types of
            innovative experiences.
            <br /> <br /> We will create a Metaverse-Native entertainment
            franchise to push the boundaries of the entertainment industry. Our
            team of 3D artists, VR specialists, designers, and storytellers are
            working together to create The MetaSaviors: a collection of 8004
            soldiers ready to save the Metaverse. Our goal is to disrupt an
            industry together with our community.

            Every holder of the MetaSaviors will receive an additional free NFT!
            <br /> <br /> No superhero storyline is complete without a sworn
            enemy. In the MetaSaviors storyline, the Metaverse is under attack
            by the evil “Deviants”. These mindless creatures have only one goal:
            to spread fear and chaos throughout the Metaverse.
            <br /> <br /> In this phase of our roadmap, our team of 3D artists,
            VR specialists, designers, and storytellers will create the
            “Deviants” collection. As a MetaSaviors holder, you will be able to
            stake your NFT on our members-only portal. As a reward, you will
            receive a free Deviant NFT. Will you join the good or the evil side
            in this epic Metaverse battle?

            Together we will bring a new type of experience into the Metaverse.
            <br /> <br /> We have established a strategic partnership with one
            of the largest landowners in Decentraland. Together we will create
            the MetaSaviors experience in the Metaverse. We have chosen to build
            in Decentraland, because this is one of the fastest growing
            Metaverses out there with a great ecosystem and a lot more growth
            potential. Building on top of an existing ecosystem enables us to
            deliver the MetaSaviors experience a lot faster to our community.
            <br /> <br /> Now you are probably wondering what this experience
            will be? Is it a game? Is it just a building on a piece of land? No,
            it is none of that. The Metaverse is enabling new types of immersive
            experiences. We want to be pioneering these new experiences with our
            community members. Curious how this will all look? We will soon
            share some previews.

            <br /> <br /> We take great care in building the strongest possible
            community around the MetaSaviors project. Part of our roadmap is
            provide exclusive member perks to our holders. These perks include
            physical merchandize, such as 3D-printed models of their NFT’s and
            also exclusive members-only events in the physical world as well as
            in the Metaverse.
            <br /> <br /> We are also working on a special piece of tech that
            our holders can use to make their NFT’s come alive in the real
            world. It is one thing to look at the art on Opensea, but it is even
            better to see the art in real life so that you can be amazed by the
            level of detail, the anatomy of the models and the textures.

            Let’s expand the franchise together..
            <br /> <br /> It takes time to build a successful entertainment
            franchise. Star Wars, The Avengers, and Pokemon took a long time to
            develop into the household names that they are today. Our team, on
            the other hand, is committed to the long haul. Our goal is to upend
            the entertainment sector, pave the path for new unique experiences,
            and establish ourselves as a MetaVerse pioneer. Over time, we'll
            expand the series with additional characters, planets, storylines,
            and games. But, in order to provide you with the best possible
            experience, we'll take it one step at a time.
            <br /> <br /> As a community member, you will be able to take part
            in shaping The MetaSaviors franchise. MetaSaviors NFT holders get to
            vote on important matters related to the roadmap of this project.
            Together we will write Metaverse history. Our holders will also be
            rewarded with a percentage of the franchise’s profits.
